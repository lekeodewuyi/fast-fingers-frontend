# Fast fingers

Fast fingers is a fun app for practicing typing. A practice session is defined as the period of time a user tries to reproduce a sample text. Once a practice session is complete, users can get the stats for that session.

Logged in users get a a wider range of functionalities. They can save their own custom texts and they can get their average stats over time, etc.
